# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a newly initialized project named "kamba-lhains" with minimal structure. The repository currently contains only Claude Code configuration files.

## Current Structure

- `.claude/settings.local.json` - Claude Code permissions configuration allowing basic bash commands (find, ls)

## Development Setup

This project appears to be in early initialization phase. No build tools, package managers, or development frameworks have been configured yet.

## Architecture Notes

The project structure suggests this may be intended as a new project. Future development will likely require:
- Selection of programming language and framework
- Configuration of build and dependency management tools
- Establishment of project structure and conventions

## Commands

Currently no build, test, or development commands are available as the project lacks configuration files for any specific language or framework.
